# Trolley Problem

Use your cursor to look around you in the trolley, but react quickly: people's lives are at stake!

Adam explains this philosophical dilemma in simple ruby code:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}, in this game, you lose either way!"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom, in this game, you lose either way' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
